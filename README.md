A working Linux shell written in C++, done mostly by exploiting polymorphism.

Features: 

```
- Create/Remove directories
- Create/Remove files
- Enter a new directory
- Go back one directory level
- Set content of files
- Display content of files
- List all files/Directories in current directory
- commands such as: cd, ls, pwd, mkdir, rm, rmdir are all working
```

NOTE:

to create files with content, use:
`make <filename <content>`

instead of:
`echo <content> >> <filename>`
